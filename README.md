Hey there! Let's talk about my favorite Python project, the recipe search! This masterpiece was created during the amazing **Python & Apps** course by the [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/coding-kickstarter/).

I've used some pretty cool libraries and packages like **urllib.parse, tkinter, requests, and tkhtmlview**. The course covered a lot of ground with object-oriented projects, loops and functions, APIs, app building, and logical lists and dictionaries.

#### And the cherry on top? I proudly present my certificate for completing the course with distinction! You can check it out [here](https://github.com/KozlowskaAgnieszka/Python-CodeFirstGirls/blob/main/CFG%20Python%20%26%20Apps%20-%20Certificate.pdf)
